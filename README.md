# Advent of Code 2022, Written in C#

This is [Advent Of Code](adventofcode.com), a series of programming problems
that go on up until Christmas Day.

I chose C# because that's the language we're using at work, and I want to use
this to help get used to the language.

To run any particular day `xy`, run:

```sh
$ dotnet run --project Day<xy>
```

(assumes you already have the dotnet CLI installed)

Or you could import the solution into Visual Studio, and have that all done for
you. I don't like that method myself, but hey, I don't control your life.
